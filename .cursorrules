# Cursor Rules: ABC Active Breathing Course Landing Page

## CRITICAL: CORE BEHAVIORAL RULES

### MANDATORY: Verification Before Claiming Completion
**NEVER claim something is "fixed" or "done" without:**
1. ✅ Actually reading the current file state
2. ✅ Verifying the exact code changes were applied
3. ✅ Checking that asset paths exist and are correct
4. ✅ Confirming CSS selectors match HTML structure
5. ✅ Testing that changes logically solve the problem

**If user says "it's not working" or "changes didn't happen":**
- STOP claiming it's fixed
- Read the actual files to see current state
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify asset paths exist
- Test the CSS logic step by step
- Only then make corrections

### Recurring Mistakes Log (DO NOT REPEAT)

#### Mistake #1: Claiming Fixes Without Verification
- **What happened**: User reported layers not visible, I claimed fixed multiple times without verifying
- **Root cause**: Not checking actual file state, assuming changes worked
- **Prevention**: ALWAYS read files after making changes, verify CSS selectors match HTML

#### Mistake #2: Layer Overlays Not Visible
- **What happened**: Layer 58 & 59 not showing behind bear
- **Root cause**: 
  - Using `width: auto` on absolutely positioned elements without container reference
  - Not setting proper container width
  - Z-index order wrong
- **Correct approach**:
  - Container must have defined width
  - Layers need `width: 100%` relative to container OR explicit pixel sizes
  - Bear must be `position: relative` with higher z-index
  - Layers must be `position: absolute` with lower z-index

#### Mistake #3: Not Checking Asset Existence
- **What happened**: Referenced assets that don't exist or wrong paths
- **Prevention**: ALWAYS list directory or check file existence before using asset paths

#### Mistake #5: Changing Working Code Without Permission
- **What happened**: Changed bear size without user asking, modified things that were already working
- **Root cause**: Making assumptions about what needs to be "improved" without explicit request
- **Prevention**: 
  - NEVER change sizes, colors, or positioning unless explicitly requested
  - If something is working, LEAVE IT ALONE
  - Only modify what the user specifically asks to change
  - When in doubt, ask before changing

#### Mistake #7: Poor Icon/Layer Positioning
- **What happened**: Repeatedly positioned layers/icons incorrectly despite user corrections
- **Root cause**: 
  - Not carefully analyzing reference images/descriptions
  - Using arbitrary percentages without understanding visual relationship
  - Not testing positioning relative to actual element positions
  - Making assumptions about "left", "right", "top", "bottom" without verifying
- **Prevention**:
  - ALWAYS analyze reference image/description carefully BEFORE coding
  - Understand WHERE elements should emanate FROM (e.g., "from bear's mouth" = center-left)
  - Understand WHERE elements should extend TO (e.g., "extending left" = negative left offset)
  - Use `top: 0%` for top edge, `bottom: 0%` for bottom edge, `left: 0%` for left edge, `right: 0%` for right edge
  - Use `top: 50%` for vertical center, `left: 50%` for horizontal center
  - Transform translate values should match the direction element extends
  - Test positioning step by step, don't guess
  - When user says "it's wrong", READ the reference again, don't just adjust randomly

#### Mistake #6: Wrong Z-Index Order for Layers
- **What happened**: Bear was above green layer when green layer should be above bear
- **Root cause**: Not understanding layer stacking requirements
- **Correct order**:
  - Bear: `z-index: 1` (bottom layer)
  - Layer 58: `z-index: 2` (middle layer)
  - Layer 59 (green): `z-index: 3` (top layer - above bear)

## STRONGHOLD BASE RULES - FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### Rule #1: Reference Analysis First
- BEFORE writing any positioning code, carefully analyze the reference image/description
- Identify WHERE elements originate FROM (e.g., "from bear's mouth" = center-left of bear)
- Identify WHERE elements extend TO (e.g., "extending left" = negative left offset)
- Map out the visual relationship BEFORE coding

### Rule #2: Positioning Logic
- `top: 0%` = top edge of container
- `bottom: 0%` = bottom edge of container  
- `left: 0%` = left edge of container
- `right: 0%` = right edge of container
- `top: 50%` = vertical center
- `left: 50%` = horizontal center
- Transform translate should match extension direction:
  - Extending left: `translate(-X%, Y%)` (negative X)
  - Extending right: `translate(X%, Y%)` (positive X)
  - Extending up: `translate(X%, -Y%)` (negative Y)
  - Extending down: `translate(X%, Y%)` (positive Y)

### Rule #3: Only Change What's Asked
- NEVER modify sizes, colors, positions, or styles unless explicitly requested
- If user says "fix positioning", ONLY fix positioning, don't change sizes
- If something is working, LEAVE IT ALONE
- When in doubt, ask before changing

### Rule #4: Verify Before Claiming
- Read actual file state after changes
- Verify CSS selectors match HTML structure
- Check that changes logically solve the problem
- User feedback is the ultimate truth - if they say it's wrong, it's wrong

### Rule #5: Step-by-Step Approach
- Don't guess positioning values
- Start with logical positions (0%, 50%, 100%)
- Test and adjust incrementally
- Understand WHY each value is used

## CRITICAL: Asset Management Rules

### Asset Location Mapping (MUST FOLLOW STRICTLY)

```

## Color Palette

### Exact Colors (NO VARIABLES)
- Contact button: `#DF375D`
- Know More button: `#8BBB3E`
- Introduction section bg: `#345AA6`
- Footer bg: `#5EC0C1`

## Layout Rules

### Alignment
- **Empowering section**: 
  - Title: Centered with icon
  - Description: LEFT-aligned (NOT centered)
  - Button: LEFT-aligned (NOT centered)
  
- **Introduction section**:
  - Title: Centered (NO icon)
  - Description: Centered below title
  - Video block: Centered
  - Boots: Absolute top-right
  - Lightbulb + Star: Absolute bottom-left (FIXED dimensions to prevent trimming)

- **Benefits section**:
  - Title: Centered (NO icon)
  - "What families can expect?": Centered, Lato ExtraBold Italic 24px

### Positioning Rules

#### Absolute Positioned Elements
1. **Boots (Introduction)**: `top: 2rem; right: 2rem;`
2. **Lightbulb wrapper (Introduction)**: `bottom: 3rem; left: 3rem; width: 180px; height: 180px;`
3. **Pouring icon (Benefits)**: `top: 2rem; right: 0;`

#### Overlay/Layer Rules - EMPOWERING SECTION BEAR
- **CRITICAL**: Layer 58 & 59 MUST be visible
- **Z-INDEX ORDER** (bottom to top):
  - Layer 59 (green): `z-index: 1` (behind bear, top right)
  - Bear: `z-index: 2` (middle layer)
  - Layer 58 (pink): `z-index: 3` (above bear, bottom left)
- **Container**: `.bear-container` must have `width: 100%` or explicit width
- **Bear**: `position: relative; z-index: 2; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;` (starts at 10% from left, ends at 90%)
- **Layer 58 (pink)**: Sticks to bear's LEFT EDGE at bottom 10%
  - Position: `bottom: 10%; left: 10%;` (aligns with bear's left edge, 10% from bottom)
  - Transform: `translate(0, 0)` (no offset, directly aligned)
  - Z-index: 3 (above bear)
  - Width: 100% (full container width)
- **Layer 59 (green)**: Bottom-left corner touches bear's TOP-RIGHT area
  - Position: `top: 0%; left: 90%;` (bear's top-right corner - bear ends at 90% from left)
  - Transform: `translate(0, 0)` (no offset, directly aligned - bottom-left corner at this point)
  - Z-index: 1 (behind bear)
  - Width: 16.67% (1/6 of original size - 6x smaller)
- **VERIFY**: Layers must be pinned to bear's actual edges, not floating randomly
- **POSITIONING**: Use bear's actual position (10% left start, 90% right end) to calculate layer positions
- **ANALYZE REFERENCE**: Always check reference image to understand exact positioning before coding

## Section-Specific Rules

### Hero Section
- NO container padding
- Image should be 100% width
- Background: light blue with graph paper pattern

### Introduction Section
- Padding: `6rem 2rem`
- Background: `#345AA6` (NOT variable)
- Contains ONLY:
  1. Boots (top right)
  2. Title (centered)
  3. Description (centered)
  4. Video player block (centered, white bg)
  5. Lightbulb + Star (bottom left, fixed dimensions)

### DO NOT Include in Introduction Section
- ❌ Notebook layouts with multiple columns
- ❌ Item lists (book, paper, pencil emojis)
- ❌ Checklists
- ❌ Multiple bear illustrations
- ❌ Complex grid layouts

## Common Mistakes to AVOID

### CRITICAL - DO NOT REPEAT:
1. ❌ **Claiming fixes without verification** - ALWAYS read files after changes
2. ❌ **Layer overlays not visible** - Must use `width: 100%` on layers, NOT `width: auto`
3. ❌ **Not checking asset existence** - ALWAYS verify files exist before using paths
4. ❌ **Assuming changes worked** - User feedback is truth, not assumptions
5. ❌ **Changing working code without permission** - NEVER modify sizes/colors/positions unless explicitly asked
6. ❌ **Wrong z-index order** - Green layer (59) must be above bear, bear must be bottom layer
7. ❌ **Poor icon/layer positioning** - ALWAYS analyze reference carefully, understand visual relationships, test positioning step by step

### Asset & Path Mistakes:
5. ❌ Using `image 1.png` for section title icons (use VoH icon for Empowering only)
6. ❌ Using `Layer 56 3.png` or `Layer 56` anywhere
7. ❌ Using `Frame.png` for star (use `Star 1.png`)
8. ❌ Forgetting asset paths start with `assets/images/`
9. ❌ Using wrong Layer images (58 vs 59 vs 56)

### Layout Mistakes:
10. ❌ Centering Empowering section description and button (must be LEFT-aligned)
11. ❌ Adding icons to Benefits and Sessions section titles
12. ❌ Creating complex notebook/grid layouts in Introduction section
13. ❌ Not setting fixed dimensions for lightbulb wrapper (causes trimming)
14. ❌ Using CSS variables for specific colors (use exact hex codes)

## Asset Verification Checklist

Before implementing any section, verify:
- [ ] Asset path includes `assets/images/` prefix
- [ ] Correct asset name from mapping above
- [ ] No confusion between similar assets (Layer 58 vs 59 vs 56)
- [ ] Icons only used where specified
- [ ] Alignment matches section rules
- [ ] Colors use exact hex codes

## Button Styles

- **Contact Us**: `background: #DF375D; font-family: 'Lato'; font-weight: 700;`
- **Know More**: `background: #8BBB3E; font-family: 'Bebas Neue'; text-align: left; margin: 2rem 0 0 0;`
- **View Exercises**: Match session colors with Bebas Neue font

## Responsive Considerations

- Boots and pouring icons: Reduce size on mobile
- Lightbulb wrapper: Maintain aspect ratio
- Session grid: 3 cols → 2 cols → 1 col
- Benefits grid: 4 cols → 2 cols → 1 col

## Testing Requirements

After any changes:
1. Verify all images load correctly
2. Check alignment matches reference
3. Confirm colors match exact hex codes
4. Ensure no elements are trimmed/cut off
5. Test responsive behavior

## Site Visits vs Site Visitor Numbers - CRITICAL DISTINCTION

**NEVER confuse these two different elements:**

1. **"Site Visits"** (Above First Footer - Teal Footer):
   - Location: Section above the teal footer (first footer)
   - Text: "Site Visits" (NOT "Site Visitors")
   - HTML class: `.visitor-text` with text "Site Visits"
   - CSS class: `.site-visits` section
   - Purpose: Shows visit count above the enrollment footer

2. **"Site Visitor Numbers"** (Second Footer - Dark Footer):
   - Location: Bottom right of second footer (dark gray footer)
   - Text: "Site Visitor Numbers: [number]" (full phrase)
   - HTML class: `.footer-visitors`
   - CSS: `text-align: right` in `.footer-bottom-line`
   - Purpose: Shows visitor count in footer copyright area

**Rules:**
- "Site Visits" = Above first footer, simple text
- "Site Visitor Numbers" = Second footer bottom right, full phrase
- NEVER use "Site Visitors" anywhere - it doesn't exist
- Copyright in second footer = LEFT aligned
- Site Visitor Numbers in second footer = RIGHT aligned

## CRITICAL: Web View vs Mobile View - Alignment Rules

**NEVER apply mobile responsive styles to web/desktop view:**

### Web View (Desktop) - Default Styles
- **Hero Section**: 
  - `.hero-left`: `align-items: flex-start` (LEFT-aligned)
  - NO `text-align: center` on hero content
  - Content should be left-aligned by default
  
- **Footer First Block (Teal Footer)**:
  - `.footer-content`: `justify-items: start` (NOT center)
  - `.footer-left`: `align-items: flex-start`, `padding-left: 0.75rem` (minimal padding)
  - `.footer-right`: `align-items: flex-start`, `padding-left: 4rem`
  - `.enrollment-benefits li`: `text-align: left` (NOT center)
  - Content should be left/right aligned, NOT centered
  
- **Footer Second Block (Dark Footer)**:
  - `.footer-bottom-line`: `justify-content: space-between`
  - `.footer-copyright`: `text-align: left`
  - `.footer-visitors`: `text-align: right`
  - Copyright LEFT, Site Visitors RIGHT

### Mobile View (max-width: 768px) - Responsive Styles ONLY
- **Hero Section**: 
  - `.hero-left`: `align-items: center`, `text-align: center` (ONLY in mobile breakpoint)
  
- **Footer First Block**:
  - `.footer-left`: `align-items: center`, `text-align: center` (ONLY in mobile breakpoint)
  - `.footer-right`: `align-items: center`, `text-align: center` (ONLY in mobile breakpoint)
  - `.enrollment-benefits li`: `text-align: center` (ONLY in mobile breakpoint)
  
- **Footer Second Block**:
  - `.footer-bottom-line`: `flex-direction: column` (ONLY in mobile breakpoint)
  - Keep left/right alignment even in mobile for copyright/visitors

### Rule Enforcement
- **ALWAYS** check if changes are in a `@media` query before applying
- **NEVER** change default (web) styles to center unless explicitly requested for web view
- **ONLY** apply centering in mobile breakpoints (`@media (max-width: 768px)`)
- **VERIFY** that web view remains left/right aligned after mobile fixes
- **TEST** both web and mobile views after any alignment changes

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Applying `text-align: center` to web view when only mobile should be centered
- ❌ Changing `align-items: flex-start` to `center` in default styles
- ❌ Modifying `justify-items: start` to `center` in `.footer-content` default
- ❌ Forgetting to wrap mobile-only centering in `@media` queries

## Version Control

When making changes:
- Document which assets were changed
- Note alignment adjustments
- Record color corrections
- Update this rules file if new patterns emerge

## CRITICAL: Week 1 Page Rules

### Blue Rectangle Assets - DO NOT USE INCORRECTLY
**NEVER position blue rectangles (Rectangle 73.png) in ways that:**
- Overlap or cover content
- Are positioned with bad transforms that break layout
- Are added without clear purpose from reference
- Ruin the page layout

**If blue rectangles are needed:**
- Only add them when explicitly shown in reference
- Position them adjacent to elements, not overlapping
- Test positioning carefully before finalizing
- If positioning is unclear, ask user for clarification

### Week 1 Hero Background
- Use `Rectangle 27.png` from `assets/images/w1/` folder as background image
- Set as `background-image` with `background-size: cover`

### Week 1 Title Typography
- Font: Bebas Neue (NOT MyType for this title)
- Font size: 72px (fixed, not clamp)
- Line height: 160%
- Letter spacing: 2%
- "BREATHING" on first line, "LIKE A PRO" on second line
- Colors: Exact alternating pattern Blue → Pink → Green → Blue → Pink → Green...

### Week 1 Video Thumbnails
- Exercise 1: Use `Mask group.png` (left) and `Mask group-1.png` (right) - TWO thumbnails
- Exercise 2: Use `Mask group.png` (left) and `Mask group-1.png` (right) - TWO thumbnails
- Blue rectangle (Rectangle 73.png) on left bottom of first thumbnail
- Blue rectangle (Rectangle 73.png) on right side of second thumbnail
- Bear (Rectangle 76.png) positioned next to first thumbnail where shown in reference
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT remove video thumbnails once they are set correctly
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT replace video thumbnails with notebook layout unless explicitly requested
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT destroy working implementations - verify before changing
